# recipe_mgmt_app

This is app was created in order to support you while buying food for your favourite recipies. 

The idea of this app came into my mind when I was cooking a lot and was looking for new recipes every day. Almost every recipe was new so I had to write down a list of ingredients each time and then sum them up. It was done to use time in the supermarket more efficiently.

Here is the basic idea of this application:
  1. create a list where your recipes will be stored (it is possible to create many lists like that)
  2. create recipes which you want to cook
  3. show ingredients from the chosen recipes summed up if appeared more than once

TODO:
  * find as many bugs as possible and fix them
  * extend the functionality
